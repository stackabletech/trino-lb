# Persistence

Currently the following persistence implementations are available:

1. [In-memory](./in-memory.md): Volatile persistence mainly intended for development or testing purposes.
2. [Redis](./redis.md): Uses a [Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/) as a distributed key-value store.
3. [Postgres](./postgres.md): **Experimental**, as performance measurements are missing.
