All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Use redis [`ConnectionManager`](https://docs.rs/redis/latest/redis/aio/struct.ConnectionManager.html) to re-connect on
  Redis connection failures. Previously trino-lb would stop working once the Redis Pod restarted. This change only
  affects the single Redis instance connection, *not* the cluster mode connection, as a
  [ClusterConnection](https://docs.rs/redis/latest/redis/cluster/struct.ClusterConnection.html) does not seem to support
  a [`ConnectionManager`](https://docs.rs/redis/latest/redis/aio/struct.ConnectionManager.html) ([#34]).

## [0.2.0] - 2024-04-07

### Added

- BREAKING: Add support for single instance redis persistence (without Redis cluster mode).
  This is breaking, because you need to set `trinoLb.persistence.redis.clusterMode: true` in your config to keep using
  the cluster mode ([#15]).
